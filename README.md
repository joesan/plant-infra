## plant-infra

Infrastructure scripts for the complete plant-simulator set of applications. We will use K8s to manage our cattles!

Scripts are currently supported only for Mac OSX and Linix

So basically, I have several scripts with which I can either bring up a K8s cluster on a set of Raspberry Pi's or I can set them up on any cloud provider (Currently supporting only AWS and Azure)
